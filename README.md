🔗 DevLinker: Developer Profile Aggregator
📌 Project Overview
DevLinker is a powerful full-stack web application that enables developers to aggregate, manage, and showcase their coding and professional profiles from multiple platforms — all in one place. Inspired by the need for a centralized developer identity, DevLinker allows users to connect their GitHub, LeetCode, HackerRank, LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter/X, and more, offering a unified, visually rich dashboard with analytics, achievements, and a professional portfolio URL.
Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it serves developers, recruiters, and hiring managers by making it easier to present and evaluate technical journeys.
